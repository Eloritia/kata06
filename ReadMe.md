## Goal

Solve [Kata 06 Anagrams](http://codekata.com/kata/kata06-anagrams/)

## How to Run

cd into the kata06 directory and run

`node kata06.jsx`

This will run whatever is written in wordsList.txt against the program and output a new file into the directory.

Or you can just open the directory in VsCode and use the lauch script.
